# CODSOFT Internship Tasks

Welcome to the CODSOFT Internship Tasks Repository! This repository contains details of three tasks assigned during the internship period in the field of Data Science. Each task focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and prediction.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The first task involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

### Contents
- `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset containing passenger information.

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

### Overview
In the second task, is working on predicting movie ratings based on various features such as genre, actors, director, and user reviews. The dataset consists of information about different movies along with their ratings. The goal objective is to develop a model that can predict the rating of a movie accurately.

### Contents
- `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- `movies.csv`: Dataset containing information about movies and their ratings.

## Task 3: Sales Prediction Using Python

### Overview
The third task revolves around predicting sales using Python. It provided with a dataset containing historical sales data along with other relevant features such as advertising expenditure, seasonality, and promotions. The Goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future sales based on these factors.

### Contents
- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and sales prediction.
- `sales_data.csv`: Dataset containing historical sales data and relevant features.

## Getting Started

To get started with each task, simply navigate to the respective folder, open the Jupyter Notebook, and follow the instructions provided. Make sure to run each code cell sequentially to reproduce the results.


Happy analyzing and predicting!
